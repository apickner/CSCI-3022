Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.

Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",

For example, in my miniopoly turn function, when I'm in jail, I decided to return my state as 'jail'. This accounts for the first if statement where I just return -20 for the \"jail fee\". The next if statement gets handled bizarrely, but it does in fact work for giving out the \"Passing Go\" money in the larger picture. Then I handle the cases where the player would draw a card and where no action occurs. Finally, I handle all other cases where the user simply owes the bank $25.\n",

If this was something more important than monopoly games, it might be worth it to distinguish going to jail on seperate occasions and staying in jail for a while (which I didn't distinguish). I create lists that hold a players cash and jail count, and although I know my interpretation is lazy, I believe it wouldn't change our numbers to drastically. Then, I produce my cash frequency histogram using only the cash data."

I used the total number of bankrupt people or total number of people who'd been to jail twice or more as my denomenator. I then made my numerator the total number of people that went bankrupt and went to jail twice or more. This was the same for D and E, and I'm not 100% this is correct, but it seems plausible.\n",

It seems more players who went to jail frequently also went bankrupt, and it seems like a lot of people who went to jail (even frequently) didn't necessarily go bankrupt more."
